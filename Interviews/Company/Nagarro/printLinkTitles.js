    await driver.get('https://yourwebsite.com'); // Replace with your website URL

    // Find all links (anchor tags) on the page
    let links = await driver.findElements(By.tagName('a'));

    // Loop through the links and print their titles
    for (let i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
      let link = links[i];
      let title = await link.getAttribute('title'); // Get the title attribute of the link
      console.log(`Link ${i + 1}: ${title}`);
    }
  } finally {
    // Close the browser
    await driver.quit();
  }
